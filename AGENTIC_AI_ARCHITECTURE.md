### Building a toolkit

We can create different types of LLM-based tools to handle various specialized tasks:

- Transformation Tools: Converting between different data formats and structures
- Analysis Tools: Providing expert insight in specific domains
- Generation Tools: Creating structured content from specifications
- Validation Tools: Checking if content meets specific criteria
- Extraction Tools: Pulling specific information from larger contexts

````
response = generate_response(Prompt(messages=[
                {"role": "system",
                 "content": f"You MUST produce output that adheres to the following JSON schema:\n\n{json.dumps(schema, indent=4)}. Output your JSON in a ```json markdown block."},
                {"role": "user", "content": prompt}
            ]))
````

The agent can use this tool to:

- Extract meeting details from emails, converting them to calendar-ready formats
- Transform unstructured report data into structured analytics inputs
- Convert web page content into structured product or contact information
- Process customer communications into actionable support tickets

When designing our agentâ€™s toolset, we face an important architectural decision regarding data extraction. We can either rely on the agent to use the general-purpose prompt_llm_for_json tool with dynamically generated schemas, or we can create specialized extraction tools with fixed schemas for specific types of documents. This choice reflects a classic tradeoff between flexibility and reliability.

```
# Define a fixed schema for invoice data
    invoice_schema = {
        "type": "object",
        "required": ["invoice_number", "date", "amount"],  # These fields must be present
        "properties": {
            "invoice_number": {"type": "string"},
            "date": {"type": "string", "format": "date"},
            "amount": {
                "type": "object",
                "properties": {
                    "value": {"type": "number"},
                    "currency": {"type": "string"}
                },
                "required": ["value", "currency"]
            },
            "vendor": {
                "type": "object",

                },
                "required": ["name"]
            },
            "line_items": {
                "type": "array",
                "items": {
                    "type": "object",

                        "unit_price": {"type": "number"},
                        "total": {"type": "number"}
                    },
                    "required": ["description", "total"]
                }
            }
        }
    }

    # Create a focused prompt that guides the LLM in invoice extraction
    extraction_prompt = f"""
    Extract invoice information from the following document text.
    Focus on identifying:
    - Invoice number (usually labeled as 'Invoice #', 'Reference', etc.)
    - Date (any dates labeled as 'Invoice Date', 'Issue Date', etc.)
    - Amount (total amount due, including currency)
    - Vendor information (company name, tax ID if present, address)
    - Line items (individual charges and their details)

    Document text:
    {document_text}
